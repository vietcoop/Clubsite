Sign-Up
---

Users, whether they were invited or used an invitation code, 

  must fill a registration form
    asking them about their motivation for joining (text field), 
    
  a description of the organization they work for (text field), 
  
  their full name (first, last and optional middle initial), 
  desired user name 
    (with uniqueness checks to make sure that user name 
    is not already used), 

  an e-mail address 
  and a phone number. 

If they do not have an invitation code:

  they should also enter the name of one person (who must be an existing member)
  who could vouch for them.

If they have the invitation code they should enter it there.

====================
  User Inactivation
====================

  Users who have been inactive for 45 days or more are downgraded to Inactive User 
  and sent an e-mail (built on a administrative-side template) letting them know that
  they are welcome back on the forum.
  
  Once they log back in, they are immediately converted to Active User (or New User if 
  one of the field is missing).
